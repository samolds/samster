To Do
=====
Hopes
-----
* Get a real ticket tracker

* Make sure image serving is correctly working
* Comment Code
* Unit Test
* Facebook API?? (HAH! ...not...)
* Upgrade from Django 1.5 to Django 1.7
* Improve the security of the Django Admin login panel. Research Django authentication stuff

Realistic
---------
* CLEAN UP CODE
* Make loading gif on front page randomly select one of my favorite gifs (compress and make same height)
* Combine front_page.html and ajax.html
* On mobile, make content section not have much side padding. Have everything fill horizontally
* Have each API call made individually and then weaved together (include json-able date)
* Include any lastfm "Now Playing" on the front page under random quote?
* Make sure I only have necessary dependencies in settings.py (Don't need cucumber anymore?)
* Get Imgur API working: https://api.imgur.com/oauth2#auth_url
* Simplify background texture (Smaller with repeats?)
* Add minimal texture to navbar? (Smaller with repeats?)
* Make a better favicon
* Design things to be more minimal?
* DEPLOY TO GOOGLE APP ENGINE
* Restructure model.py to work with a non-relational database http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine
* Fix console error on front page
* Make The Front Page load information asynchronously (ajax, jquery, celery) and then locally cache it. Also, get it to automatically recache after the cache expires?
